# gem-mod-discord
A Discord webhook that uses Google Gemini to moderate your server.

# Requirements
* Discord.py SDK
* Discord Developer account
* Google GenAI SDK
* Python 3.5+

# How it works
uhhhhhhhhh

# Limitations
Python is slow asf. Rate limits and quota limits on Google's end exist. Keys may be banned if anything explicit is sent. I have no clue what I am doing (still not vibe coded tho).
